# Dynamic button plugin for Sketch.app Version 3.5+ 

Dynamic button plug-in for [Sketch.app](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) allows to create buttons with fixed paddings no matter what text you add. 


## Updates 

* Sept 20 - [**Supports v40** 👍 👍 👍 👍 (Click to Download)](https://github.com/fuggfuggfugg/sketch-dynamic-button-3.5/archive/master.zip)

New Features [Demo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5616123/18656128/94614d62-7ebc-11e6-870e-5314fa1bd2ec.gif)
* Also supports single values in the text layer. ie 15 + <Cmd+J> will create button with 15px padding. 
* Plugin now applies to only text layer and ignores any other layers. This way if you select the BG layer by mistake and run dynamic button it wont create extra folders around the BG layer. Also if you select multiple layers and run dynamic button it will only apply the changes to the text layer and ignore any other layers. You do not need to worry about making any mistakes and reverting them back.
